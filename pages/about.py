st.text("""I am a Data Scientist specialized in football, with experience applying analytical techniques to understand the game in depth and provide strategic support for technical and managerial decision-making. My work combines advanced technical skills, sharp tactical interpretation, and clear communication, always focused on delivering practical and tailored solutions.

I am proficient in Python and its core libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, NumPy), which I use to structure full analytical pipelines—from data collection and cleaning to modeling and visualization. I also have solid experience with MongoDB, a database I use to store my own football dataset, collected through web scraping. This infrastructure enables fast, thorough, and context-adapted analyses across different competitive environments.

I develop interactive and explanatory dashboards in Streamlit, transforming complex data into accessible and meaningful visualizations. I have published several of these dashboards, which assist coaches, analysts, and managers in interpreting information with clarity, thereby facilitating evidence-based decision-making.

A distinguishing element of my work is the use of graph theory and centrality measures (eigenvector centrality, PageRank, closeness, load centrality) to analyze passing networks and collective behaviors. This approach reveals tactical structures and circulation dynamics that often go unnoticed in traditional analyses, allowing the game to be understood as an interconnected and dynamic system.

Additionally, I possess strong tactical knowledge, with a preference for positional play, which allows me to contextualize metrics and patterns within well-defined game models. I believe each analysis must be custom-built, respecting the particularities of each team, opponent, and match situation. I am self-taught, curious, and committed to innovation. My publications on social media demonstrate the practical application of my expertise and my ability to communicate complex ideas clearly.

I am confident that my combination of technical proficiency, analytical vision, and deep understanding of the game can contribute meaningfully to your projects. I remain at your disposal for any further information and appreciate your consideration.""")
