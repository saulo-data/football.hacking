st.text("""You’ve just entered a data–driven environment designed to transform raw football events into structured, interpretable, and decision-ready insights.

Our platform integrates automated data acquisition, advanced preprocessing pipelines, and analytical models that highlight patterns invisible to traditional metrics. Every chart, table, and metric is dynamically generated, allowing you to explore match behavior through reproducible, transparent, and noise-free data.

From pass-network structures and possession sequences to xT/xG distributions and spatial-temporal interactions, Football Hacking provides a complete analytical ecosystem built for professionals who require precision, clarity, and technical depth.

This is where football meets computation — and where informed decisions replace intuition.""")
